* Integrated tags based search in Anoncreds workflow:
    * Updated `indy_prover_store_credential` API function to create tags for a stored credential object.
    * API functions `indy_prover_get_credentials` and `indy_prover_get_credentials_for_proof_req` marked as `Deprecated`.
    * Added two chains of APIs related to credentials search that allows fetching records by batches:
        * Simple credentials search - `indy_prover_search_credentials`
        * Search credentials for proof request - `indy_prover_search_credentials_for_proof_req`
    * Supported [WQL query language](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/doc/design/011-wallet-query-language) for all search functions in Anoncreds API.
* Added `indy_prover_get_credential` API function allows to get human-readable credential by the specific id from Wallet.
* Performed changes related to Libindy Wallet behavior:
    * Changed Wallet export serialization format to use the same message pack as the rest of LibIndy.
    * Removed association between Wallet and Pool.
    * Removed persistence of Wallet configuration by Libindy.
    * Updated `wallet_create`, `wallet_open`, `wallet_delete` functions to accept wallet configuration as a single JSON.
* Performed changes related to Libindy [Pool behavior](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/doc/design/009-efficient-connections):
    * Changed Pool connection logic to avoid unnecessary opened connections.
    * Changed Catch-up process to get all transactions from a single node.
    * Implemented logic of persisting of actual Pool Leger at the end of catch-up process and starting from this point on the next time.
    * Updated format of `config` parameter in `indy_open_pool_ledger` API function to specify runtime Pool configuration.
* Payment API has been updated to support non-UTXO based crypto payments and traditional payments like VISA.
Performed the following changes related to Libindy Payments API:
    * Changed format of input and output parameters.
    * Changed format of result values of `indy_parse_response_with_fees` and `indy_parse_payment_response` API functions.
    * Renamed `indy_build_get_utxo_request` and `indy_parse_get_utxo_response` API functions.
    * Added `indy_build_verify_payment_req` and `indy_parse_verify_payment_response` API functions.
    * Removed EXPERIMENTAL notice from endpoints.
* Added `ledger verify-payment-receipt` command in Indy CLI.
* Bugfixes
* 1.6.1 bugfixes
    * Fix connection performance issue

Notes:

* Wallet format of libindy v1.6 isn't compatible with a wallet format of libindy v1.5. As result it is impossible to use wallets
  created with older libindy versions with libindy v1.6.
* There is [migration guide](doc/migration-guide-1.5.0-1.6.0.md) about API changes.
