libindy (1.11.0) unstable; urgency=medium

[ Hyperledger ]

## 1.11.0
* Updated `indy_append_txn_author_agreement_acceptance_to_request` function to discard the time portion of `acceptance time` on appending TAA metadata into request.
It was done cause too much time precision can lead to privacy risk.
    *NOTE* that if the following points are met:
    - Indy Pool consists of nodes with version less 1.9.2
    - Transaction Author Agreement is set on the Pool
    Requests to the Pool will fail during the day TAA was set.
* Added new Payment API functions (`indy_build_get_payment_sources_with_from_request` and `indy_parse_get_payment_sources_with_from_response`) to get payment sources with pagination support.
Old `indy_build_get_payment_sources_request` and `indy_parse_get_payment_sources_response` were marked as *Deprecated*.
    *NOTE* that `indy_register_payment_method` API function was updated to accept callbacks correspondent to the new functions instead of deprecated.
* Added new Payment API functions (`indy_sign_with_address` and `indy_verify_with_address`) to sign/verify a message with a payment address.
    *NOTE* that `indy_register_payment_method` API function was updated to accept additional callbacks correspondent to the new functions.
* Added new *EXPEREMENTAL* functions to get requirements and price for a ledger request.
    * `indy_get_request_info` - returns request requirements (with minimal price) correspondent to specific auth rule in case the requester can perform this action.
* Added new API function `indy_append_request_endorser` to append Endorser to an existing request.
It allows writing transactions to the ledger with preserving an original author but by different Endorser.
An example flow can be found here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/docs/configuration.md
* Added new API function `indy_generate_nonce` to generate a nonce of the size recommended for usage within a proof request.
* Updated behavior of `indy_prover_create_proof` to create revocation proof based on `non_revoked` timestamps in a proof request. Now only `primary` proof can be built if `non_revoked` intervals were not requested by a verifier.
* Updated `constraint` parameter of `indy_build_auth_rule_request` Libindy Ledger API function to accept new optional `off_ledger_signature` field that specifies if a signature of unknown `DID` is allowed for an action performing (false by default).
* Improved state proof verification to support pagination.
* Bugfixes:
    * others minor bugfixes

## 1.10.1
* Bugfixes
    * Fixed `State Proof` verification for GET_REVOC_REG_DELTA requests in case of from and to are before first entry.

* Bugfixes

## 1.9.0
* Added a set of functions to support work with `Transaction Author Agreement` concept
   This guarantees that every write transaction author agree that the information they submit
   to the ledger meets the requirements outlined by ledger governance.
    * `indy_build_txn_author_agreement_request` to add a new version of Transaction Author Agreement to the ledger.
    * `indy_build_get_txn_author_agreement_request` to get a Transaction Author Agreement from the ledger.
    * `indy_build_acceptance_mechanisms_request` to add new acceptance mechanisms for transaction author agreement.
    * `indy_build_get_acceptance_mechanisms_request` to get acceptance mechanisms from the ledger.
    * `indy_append_txn_author_agreement_acceptance_to_request` to append transaction author agreement acceptance data to a request.
    * `indy_append_txn_author_agreement_acceptance_to_request` to append transaction author agreement acceptance data to a request.
    * `indy_prepare_payment_extra_with_acceptance_data` to prepare payment extra JSON with TAA acceptance data.
* Updated `indy_verifier_verify_proof` function to check restrictions on requested predicates during validation of proof.
* Updated Libindy to use [Ursa](https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa) instead of [Indy-Crypto](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-crypto).
* Added *EXPERIMENTAL* `Cache API` to Libindy that provides an ability to get and to store schemas and credential definitions into the wallet.
    * `indy_get_cred_def` to get credential definition for specified credential definition id.
    * `indy_purge_cred_def_cache` to purge credential definition cache.
    * `indy_get_schema` to get schema for specified schema id.
    * `indy_purge_schema_cache` to purge schema cache.
* Implemented `State Proof` verification for some types of GET requests to the ledger.
* Bugfixes:
    * others minor bugfixes

## 1.8.3

    *  Fixed behavior of `auth_rule` and `get_auth_rule` request builders.
    * Fixed `boolean` datatype representation for FFI.
    * others minor bugfixes

## 1.8.2
 Added new functions to Libindy Ledger API:
    * `indy_build_auth_rule_request` to change an existing ledger auth rule.
    * `indy_build_get_auth_rule_request` to get either specific one or all ledger auth rules.
* Removed Deprecation warnings from `indy_crypto_anon_crypt` and `indy_crypto_anon_decrypt` functions.
* Restart catchup in case of outdated pool cache.
* Bugfixes

* 1.8.1
    * Bugfixes

    * Added Logging API
        * Added function `indy_get_logger` for plugins to give their logging to libindy
        * Added function `indy_set_logger` for client apps and wrappers to receive logs from libindy
