# Indy SDK

This is the official SDK for [Hyperledger Indy](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects),
which provides a distributed-ledger-based foundation for [self-sovereign identity](https://sovrin.org).
The major artifact of the SDK is a c-callable
library; there are also convenience wrappers for various programming languages.

All bugs, stories, and backlog for this project are managed through [Hyperledger's Jira](https://jira.hyperledger.org)
in project IS (note that regular Indy tickets are in the INDY project instead...). Also, join
us on [Jira's Rocket.Chat](chat.hyperledger.org) at #indy-sdk to discuss.
