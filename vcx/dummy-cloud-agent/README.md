# Dummy Cloud Agent

This is simple implementation of VCX compatible Cloud Agent. 

The main purpose of this implementation is VCX testing, demos and documentation of VCX protocol. 

There is an parallel work on providing reference implementation of Agent2Agent protocol in indy-agent repo. 
We plan to migrate to this protocol and implementation soon.
