#   Module Contents
This is a small overview of what the files in this directory contain.

##  _commands
Located inside this submodule are the classes that implement the Libindy commands that can be used in a program. The
classes themselves only define the function's signatures (name, arguments and return types), as the function body is
generated by the `@libindy_command` decorator implemented in `_command.py`.

##  _command.py
In this class the decorator to generate the libindy command bodies is defined. It reads the function signatures of the
commands and generates the correct output types, callback functions, argument encoders and response decoding functions.

##  _libindy.py
This file implements the actual calling of the C-library and runs the invoked commands. The `Libindy` class implemented in here is the central piece of the whole wrapper.

## error.py
This is the location of every exception implementation this package provides. Every exception is a child of the base
`LibindyError`. It also contains a dict that maps the internally used error codes to their corresponding error types.
