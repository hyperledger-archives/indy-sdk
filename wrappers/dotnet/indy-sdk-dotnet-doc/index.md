# .NET API for the Hyperledger Indy SDK
The .NET API for the Hyperledger Indy SDK can be used with any flavor of .NET that conforms to the .NET Standard 1.0
and above including but not limited to the .NET Framework v4.5 and .NET Core 1.0 and can be used on any platform with
.NET support.

The .NET assembly is a wrapper for the C-callable Indy SDK which must be installed separately
in an appropriate location (e.g. the DLL search path in Windows). 

The SDK provides features for managing a self sovereign identity including communication between agents, storing and managing
keys and data, generation of claims, claim requests, proofs and other anonymous credentials, cryptographic functionality
and generation of messages for interacting with an Indy node pool such as the one hosting the Sovrin ledger.
