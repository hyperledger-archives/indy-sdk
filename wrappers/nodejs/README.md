## Installing

This module has a native compile step. It compiles C++ code and dynamically links to `libindy`.

You will need:

* C++ build tools and Python 2. See [this](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) for platform recommendations.
* `libindy` v1.6+ in your system library path. (i.e. `/usr/lib/libindy.so` for linux)

Then you can install via npm:

```sh
npm install --save indy-sdk
```

#### Troubleshooting
Use environment variable `RUST_LOG={info|debug|trace}` to output logs of Libindy.

##### Linking errors

i.e. `ld: library not found for -llibindy`

First, make sure you have the latest libindy for your platform. Also make sure you have any other libraries it depends on. See [indy-sdk/doc](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/doc)

Second, make sure it's in the linker search path. The easiest way is to use the system library path.
* ubuntu `/usr/lib/libindy.so`
* osx `/usr/local/lib/libindy.dylib`
* windows `c:\windows\system32\indy.dll`

If you want to put the library in a custom folder i.e. `/foo/bar/libindy.so` then you can do this:
```sh
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/foo/bar npm i --save indy-sdk
```
Then when you run your code, you'll still need the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` set.
```sh
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/foo/bar node index.js
```

##### Other build errors

We use [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) to manage the cross-platform build. Their readme is quite helpful.

## Usage

```js
var indy = require('indy-sdk')

var did = '...'
var fullVerkey = '...'

indy.abbreviateVerkey(did, fullVerkey, function(err, verkey){
  ..
})

// if you do not provide a callback, a Promise is returned

var verkey = await indy.abbreviateVerkey(did, fullVerkey)
```

# API

### IndyError

All the functions may yield an IndyError. The errors are based on libindy error codes defined [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/libindy/include/indy_mod.h).

* `err.indyCode`: Int - code number from libindy
* `err.indyName`: String - name for the error code
* `err.indyMessage`: String - human-readable error description
* `err.indyBacktrace`: String? - if enabled, this is the libindy backtrace string

Collecting of backtrace can be enabled by:
1. Setting environment variable `RUST_BACKTRACE=1`
2. Calling [setRuntimeConfig](#setruntimeconfig--config-)(`{collect_backtrace: true}`)

### anoncreds

These functions wrap the Ursa algorithm as documented in this [paper](https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/blob/master/libursa/docs/AnonCred.pdf):

And is documented in this [HIPE](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/c761c583b1e01c1e9d3ceda2b03b35336fdc8cc1/text/anoncreds-protocol/README.md):

#### issuerCreateSchema \( issuerDid, name, version, attrNames \) -&gt; \[ id, schema \]

Create credential schema entity that describes credential attributes list and allows credentials
interoperability.

Schema is public and intended to be shared with all anoncreds workflow actors usually by publishing SCHEMA transaction
to Indy distributed ledger.

It is IMPORTANT for current version POST Schema in Ledger and after that GET it from Ledger
with correct seq\_no to save compatibility with Ledger.
After that can call issuerCreateAndStoreCredentialDef to build corresponding Credential Definition.

* `issuerDid`: String - DID of schema issuer
* `name`: String - a name the schema
* `version`: String - a version of the schema
* `attrNames`: Json - a list of schema attributes descriptions (the number of attributes should be less or equal than 125)
* __->__ [ `id`: String, `schema`: Json ] - schema\_id: identifier of created schema
schema\_json: schema as json

Errors: `Common*`, `Anoncreds*`

#### issuerCreateAndStoreCredentialDef \( wh, issuerDid, schema, tag, signatureType, config \) -&gt; \[ credDefId, credDef \]

Create credential definition entity that encapsulates credentials issuer DID, credential schema, secrets used for signing credentials
and secrets used for credentials revocation.

Credential definition entity contains private and public parts. Private part will be stored in the wallet. Public part
will be returned as json intended to be shared with all anoncreds workflow actors usually by publishing CRED\_DEF transaction
to Indy distributed ledger.

It is IMPORTANT for current version GET Schema from Ledger with correct seq\_no to save compatibility with Ledger.

* `wh`: Handle (Number) - wallet handle (created by openWallet)
* `issuerDid`: String - a DID of the issuer signing cred\_def transaction to the Ledger
* `schema`: Json - credential schema as a json
* `tag`: String - allows to distinct between credential definitions for the same issuer and schema
* `signatureType`: String - credential definition type \(optional, 'CL' by default\) that defines credentials signature and revocation math. Supported types are:
  *  'CL': Camenisch-Lysyanskaya credential signature type that is implemented according to the algorithm in this paper:
                https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/blob/master/libursa/docs/AnonCred.pdf
           And is documented in this HIPE:
               https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/c761c583b1e01c1e9d3ceda2b03b35336fdc8cc1/text/anoncreds-protocol/README.md

* `config`: Json - \(optional\) type-specific configuration of credential definition as json:
  *  'CL':
    *  support\_revocation: whether to request non-revocation credential \(optional, default false\)
* __->__ [ `credDefId`: String, `credDef`: Json ] - cred\_def\_id: identifier of created credential definition
cred\_def\_json: public part of created credential definition

Errors: `Common*`, `Wallet*`, `Anoncreds*`

#### issuerCreateAndStoreRevocReg \( wh, issuerDid, revocDefType, tag, credDefId, config, tailsWriterHandle \) -&gt; \[ revocRegId, revocRegDef, revocRegEntry \]

Create a new revocation registry for the given credential definition as tuple of entities
- Revocation registry definition that encapsulates credentials definition reference, revocation type specific configuration and
secrets used for credentials revocation
- Revocation registry state that stores the information about revoked entities in a non-disclosing way. The state can be
represented as ordered list of revocation registry entries were each entry represents the list of revocation or issuance operations.

Revocation registry definition entity contains private and public parts. Private part will be stored in the wallet. Public part
will be returned as json intended to be shared with all anoncreds workflow actors usually by publishing REVOC\_REG\_DEF transaction
to Indy distributed ledger.

Revocation registry state is stored on the wallet and also intended to be shared as the ordered list of REVOC\_REG\_ENTRY transactions.
This call initializes the state in the wallet and returns the initial entry.

Some revocation registry types \(for example, 'CL\_ACCUM'\) can require generation of binary blob called tails used to hide information about revoked credentials in public
revocation registry and intended to be distributed out of leger \(REVOC\_REG\_DEF transaction will still contain uri and hash of tails\).
This call requires access to pre-configured blob storage writer instance handle that will allow to write generated tails.

                    https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/blob/master/libursa/docs/AnonCred.pdf
                  This type is default for 'CL' credential definition type.
* `tag`: String - allows to distinct between revocation registries for the same issuer and credential definition
* `credDefId`: String - id of stored in ledger credential definition
* `config`: Json - type-specific configuration of revocation registry as json:

        2) ISSUANCE_ON_DEMAND: nothing is issued initially accumulator is 1 (used by default);
    "max_cred_num": maximum number of credentials the new registry can process (optional, default 100000)
}
````
* `tailsWriterHandle`: Handle (Number) - handle of blob storage to store tails
* __->__ [ `revocRegId`: String, `revocRegDef`: Json, `revocRegEntry`: Json ] - revoc\_reg\_id: identifier of created revocation registry definition

#### keyForDid \( poolHandle, wh, did \) -&gt; key

Returns ver key \(key id\) for the given DID.

"keyForDid" call follow the idea that we resolve information about their DID from
the ledger with cache in the local wallet. The "openWallet" call has freshness parameter
that is used for checking the freshness of cached pool value.

Note if you don't want to resolve their DID info from the ledger you can use
"keyForLocalDid" call instead that will look only to the local wallet and skip
freshness checking.

Note that "createAndStoreMyDid" makes similar wallet record as "createKey".
As result we can use returned ver key in all generic crypto and messaging functions.

#### getResponseMetadata \( response \) -&gt; responseMetadata

Parse transaction response to fetch metadata.
The important use case for this method is validation of Node's response freshens.

Distributed Ledgers can reply with outdated information for consequence read request after write.
To reduce pool load libindy sends read requests to one random node in the pool.
Consensus validation is performed based on validation of nodes multi signature for current ledger Merkle Trie root.
This multi signature contains information about the latest ldeger's transaction ordering time and sequence number that this method returns.

If node that returned response for some reason is out of consensus and has outdated ledger
it can be caught by analysis of the returned latest ledger's transaction ordering time and sequence number.

There are two ways to filter outdated responses:
1\) based on "seqNo" - sender knows the sequence number of transaction that he consider as a fresh enough.
2\) based on "txnTime" - sender knows the timestamp that he consider as a fresh enough.

Note: response of GET\_VALIDATOR\_INFO request isn't supported

* `response`: Json - response of write or get request.
* __->__ `responseMetadata`: Json - response metadata.
```
{
    "seqNo": Option<u64> - transaction sequence number,

### logger

WARNING: You can only set the logger **once**. Call `setLogger`, `setDefaultLogger`, not both. Once it's been set, libindy won't let you change it.

#### setDefaultLogger \( pattern \)

Calling this turns on the default logger and libindy will write logs to stdout.

* `pattern`: String - pattern that corresponds with the log messages to show.

Errors: `Common*`

NOTE: This is a synchronous function (does not return a promise.)

#### setLogger \( logFn \)

Set a function to be called every time a log is emitted from libindy.

* `logFn`: Function(Int level, String target, String message, String module_path, String file, Int line)

Example:
```js
indy.setLogger(function (level, target, message, modulePath, file, line) {
    console.log('libindy said:', level, target, message, modulePath, file, line)
})
```

Errors: `Common*`

NOTE: This is a synchronous function (does not return a promise) but may call `logFn` asynchronously many times.

### cache

#### getSchema \( poolHandle, wh, submitterDid, id, options \) -&gt; schema

    NOTE: must be set before invocation of any other API functions.
}
```

Errors: `Common*`

NOTE: This is a synchronous function (does not return a promise.)

## Advanced

If you need to get closer to the metal, you can access the node bindings directly.

* The function names and parameters are the same.
* It will not json stringify or parse for you.
* Only callbacks.
* Errors are plain numbers for indy error codes.

```js
var indy = require('indy-sdk')

indy.capi.abbreviateVerkey(did, fullVerkey, function(err, verkey){
  // err will be 0 on success, and a code number on failure
  // verkey will be the result string on success
})
```
