This is the official documentation for the `Hyperledger Indy SDK <https://www.hyperledger.org/projects>`_,
which provides a distributed-ledger-based foundation for `self-sovereign identity <https://sovrin.org>`_. 
Indy provides a software ecosystem for private, secure, and powerful identity, and the Indy SDK enables clients for it.
The major artifact of the SDK is a c-callable library; there are also convenience wrappers 
for various programming languages and Indy CLI tool.

All bugs, stories, and backlog for this project are managed through 
`Hyperledger's Jira <https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa>`_ in project IS 
(note that regular Indy tickets are in the INDY project instead...). Also, make sure to join
us on `Hyperledger's Rocket.Chat <https://chat.hyperledger.org/>`_ at 
`#indy-sdk <https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-sdk>`_ to discuss. You will need a Linux 
Foundation login to get access to these channels.
