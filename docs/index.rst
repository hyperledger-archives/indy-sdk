Hyperledger Indy
============================================

#.. image:: 

The codebase that the Sovrin Foundation is using for SSI is called Hyperledger Indy. Made up of several individual, yet connected repositories, Hyperledger Indy provides tools, libraries, and reusable components for providing digital identities rooted on blockchains or other distributed ledgers so that they are interoperable across administrative domains, applications, and any other silo.

Hyperledger Indy’s active community has various channels of collaboration. You can join Indy’s Mailing List, Chat Room, and Working Group Calls for direct interaction with others who are working on and with the code.

Collaboration will be a great resource for you as you get your hands in the code. Your first step should be the Indy Getting Started guide.
