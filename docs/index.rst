Hyperledger Indy
================

.. image:: images/hyperledger_indy_logo.png

The codebase that the Sovrin Foundation is using for SSI is called Hyperledger Indy. Made up of several individual, yet connected repositories, Hyperledger Indy provides tools, libraries, and reusable components for providing digital identities rooted on blockchains or other distributed ledgers so that they are interoperable across administrative domains, applications, and any other silo.

Hyperledger Indy’s active community has various channels of collaboration. You can join Indy’s **Mailing List**, **Chat Room**, and **Working Group Calls** for direct interaction with others who are working on and with the code.

Collaboration will be a great resource for you as you get your hands in the code. Your first step should be the Indy **Getting Started Guide**.

Getting Started Guide
---------------------
In a classic Alice-Bob example, the `Getting Started Guide <https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/getting-started/getting-started.md>`_ will walk you through basic Indy transactions. See these `instructions <https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/README.md>`_ to install the SDK.

Indy Chat Room
--------------
Hyperledger’s `chat room <https://chat.hyperledger.org/>`_ is made up of numerous channels. Questions and discussion should be directed to the `appropriate <https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/indy#communication>`_ chat room.

Indy Working Group Calls
------------------------
The Indy Working Group Calls take place every Thursday at `3:00 PM UTC <https://www.google.com/search?q=3%3A00+PM+UTC>`_ via Zoom.
