"""
This sample is extensions of "write_schema_and_cred_def.py"

Shows how to issue a credential as a Trust Anchor which has created a Cred Definition
for an existing Schema.

After Trust Anchor has successfully created and stored a Cred Definition using Anonymous Credentials,
Prover's wallet is created and opened, and used to generate Prover's Master Secret.
After that, Trust Anchor generates Credential Offer for given Cred Definition, using Prover's DID
Prover uses Credential Offer to create Credential Request
Trust Anchor then uses Prover's Credential Request to issue a Credential.
Finally, Prover stores Credential in its wallet.
