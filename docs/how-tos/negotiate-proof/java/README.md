The file `ProofNegotiation.java` was moved from the obsolete 
directory `how-tos/proof-negotiation` and was renamed to 
`NegotiateProof.java` to be consistent with the scripts in 
other languages in the directory `negotiate-proof`.

But this Java script was not tested or validated, and all the `java` 
directory must be completed (by a Java developer) (with `steps` and other) 
like for other "how-tos" scripts.
