# Indy CLI Design

## Re-implementation of CLI
This proposal follow the idea to re-implement CLI from scratch. Main reasons are:
* Existing code base is written in hard-to support way.
* Existing code base is too far from libindy entities model.
* Existing code base requires complex runtime (python) and additional dependencies (python libindy wrapper) that complicates deployment.
* It is just cheaper to re-implement CLI than to perform deep refactoring.

## Use Rust language
We propose to re-implement CLI in Rust. Main reasons are:
* Main libindy code base uses Rust. Team has deep Rust experience.
* No need to big runtime, small list of dependencies. As result simple packaging and deployment.
* Rust is nice and reliable cross-platform solution for native apps.

## Terminal input-output handling
To handle complex terminal input, history and autocompletion support on different terminals linefeed crate will be used (few additional alternatives are also available). To handle colored terminal output ansi_term crate will be used.

## Auto completion
The following autocompletion will be provided through readline infrastructure:
* Command group name completion
* Command name completion
* Command param name completion

## Libindy wrapper
CLI project will contain simple synchronous libindy wrapper:
* Code from libindy tests that provides similar wrapper will be partially reused.
* Synchronization will be performed through Rust channels:
  * Main thread creates channel and closure that will send message to this channel.
  * Calls libindy and puts this closure as callback.
  * Blocks on reading from channel.

As channel reading assumes timeouts it will be possible to emulate progress updating .

## Threading model
There will be one main thread that will perform io operations with terminal and libindy calls synchronized through Rustâ€™s channel. Blocking will be limited by small channel read timeout.

## Execution modes
CLI will support 2 execution modes:
* Interactive. In this mode CLI will read commands from terminal interactively.
* Batch. In this code all commands will be read from file or pipe and executed in series.

## Code structure
* CLI code will define "Command" structure that will be container for:
  * Command meta information (name, command help, supported params, params help)
  * "Executor" function that will contain command execution logic
  * "Cleaner" function that will contain command cleanup logic
* Each command will be implemented as Rust module with one public "new" function that returns configured "Command" instance
* All commands will share one "CommandContext". "CommandContext" will hold application state and contain 2 parts:
  * Pre-defined application part. Part that holds application-level state like command prompt, isExit flag and etc...
  * Generic command specific part. This part will be key-value storage that will allow commands to store command-specific data like Indy SDK handles, used DID and etc... 
* "Executor" and "Cleaner" functions will get CommandContext as parameter
* Actual execution of commands will be performed by CommandExecutor class. This class will:
  * Instantiation of shared "CommandContext"
  * Hold all commands and command grouping info
  * Parse command lines according to commands meta information and search for relevant command
  * Triggering of command execution
  * Provide line auto completion logic
  * Triggerid of command cleanup
Command instances will optionally share few contexts:
* EntryPoint will:
* Instantiate CommandExecutor and provide commands to command executor instance.
* Determine execution mode.
  * In interactive mode it will start readline cycle and execute each line with CommandExecutor until Exit command received.
  * In batch mode it will execute each command in the list and finish execution after completion of all commands.

```
### Common commands

#### Help
Print list of groups with group help:
```
indy> help

Print list of group commands with command help:
```
indy> <group> help
```
