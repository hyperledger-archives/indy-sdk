# Combined all static libaries in the current directory into a single static library
# It is hardcoded to use the i386, armv7, and armv7s architectures; this can easily be changed via the 'archs' variable at the top
# The script takes a single argument, which is the name of the final, combined library to be created.
# If libvcxpartial is passed in as the parameter, only armv7 and arm64 are packaged 
#
#   For example:
#  =>    combine_static_libraries.sh combined-library
#
# Script by Evan Schoenberg, Regular Rate and Rhythm Software
# Thanks to Claudiu Ursache for his blog post at http://www.cvursache.com/2013/10/06/Combining-Multi-Arch-Binaries/ which detailed the technique automated by this script
