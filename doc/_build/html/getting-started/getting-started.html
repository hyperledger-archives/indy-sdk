<p>Indy provides a software ecosystem for private, secure, and powerful identity, and libindy enables clients for it. Indy puts people — not the organizations that traditionally centralize identity — in charge of decisions about their own privacy and disclosure. This enables all kinds of rich innovation: connection contracts, revocation, novel payment workflows, asset and document management features, creative forms of escrow, curated reputation, integrations with other cool technologies, and so on.</p>
<p>Indy uses open-source, distributed ledger technology. These ledgers are a form of database that is provided cooperatively by a pool of participants, instead of by a giant database with a central admin. Data lives redundantly in many places, and it accrues in transactions orchestrated by many machines. Strong, industry-standard cryptography protects it. Best practices in key management and cybersecurity pervade its design. The result is a reliable, public source of truth under no single entity’s control, robust to system failure, resilient to hacking, and highly immune to subversion by hostile entities.</p>
<p>If the concepts of cryptography and blockchain details feel mysterious, fear not: this guide will help introduce you to key concepts within Indy. You’re starting in the right place.</p>

<span id="what-well-cover"></span><h2>What We’ll Cover<a class="headerlink" href="#what-well-cover" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Our goal is to introduce you to many of the concepts of Indy and give you some idea of what happens behind the scenes to make it all work.</p>
<p>We’re going to frame the exploration with a story. Alice, a graduate of the fictional Faber College, wants to apply for a job at the fictional company Acme Corp. As soon as she has the job, she wants to apply for a loan in Thrift Bank so she can buy a car. She would like to use her college transcript as proof of her education on the job application and once hired, Alice would like to use the fact of employment as evidence of her creditworthiness for the loan.</p>
<p>The sorts of identity and trust interactions required to pull this off are messy in the world today; they are slow, they violate privacy, and they are susceptible to fraud. We’ll show you how Indy is a quantum leap forward.</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="about-alice">
<span id="about-alice"></span><h2>About Alice<a class="headerlink" href="#about-alice" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As a graduate of Faber College, Alice receives an alumni newsletter where she learns that her alma mater is offering digital transcripts. She logs in to the college alumni website and requests her transcript by clicking <strong>Get Transcript</strong>.  (Other ways to initiate this request might include scanning a QR code, downloading a transcript package from a published URL, etc.)</p>
<p>Alice doesn’t realize it yet, but to use this digital transcript she will need a new type of identity — not the traditional identity that Faber College has built for her in its on-campus database, but a new and portable one that belongs to her, independent of all past and future relationships, that nobody can revoke or co-opt or correlate without her permission. This is a <strong><em>self-sovereign identity</em></strong> and it is the core feature of Indy.</p>
<p>In normal contexts, managing a self-sovereign identity will require a tool such as a desktop or mobile application. It might be a standalone app or it might leverage a third party service provider that the ledger calls an <strong>agency</strong>. The Sovrin Foundation publishes reference versions of such tools. Faber College will have studied these requirements and will recommend an <strong><em>Indy app</em></strong> to Alice if she doesn’t already have one. This app will install as part of the workflow from the <strong>Get Transcript</strong> button.</p>
<p>When Alice clicks <strong>Get Transcript</strong>, she will download a file that holds an Indy <strong>connection request</strong>. This connection request file, having an .indy extension and associated with her Indy app, will allow her to establish a secure channel of communication with another party in the ledger ecosystem — Faber College.</p>
<p>So when Alice clicks <strong>Get Transcript</strong>, she will normally end up installing an app (if needed), launching it, and then being asked by the app whether she wants to accept a request to connect with Faber.</p>
<p>For this guide, however, we’ll be using an <strong>Indy SDK API</strong> (as provided by libindy) instead of an app, so we can see what happens behind the scenes. We will pretend to be a particularly curious and technically adventurous Alice…</p>

<span id="step-1-getting-trust-anchor-credentials-for-faber-acme-thrift-and-government"></span><h3>Step 1: Getting Trust Anchor Credentials for Faber, Acme, Thrift and Government<a class="headerlink" href="#step-1-getting-trust-anchor-credentials-for-faber-acme-thrift-and-government" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Faber College and other actors have done some preparation to offer this service to Alice. To understand these steps let’s start with some definitions.</p>
<p>The ledger is intended to store <strong>Identity Records</strong> that describe a <strong>Ledger Entity</strong>. Identity Records are public data and may include Public Keys, Service Endpoints, Credential Schemas, and Credential Definitions. Every <strong>Identity Record</strong> is associated with exactly one <strong>DID</strong> (Decentralized Identifier) that is globally unique and resolvable (via a ledger) without requiring any centralized resolution authority. To maintain privacy each <strong>Identity Owner</strong> can own multiple DIDs.</p>
<p>In this tutorial we will use two types of DIDs. The first one is a <strong>Verinym</strong>. A <strong>Verinym</strong> is associated with the <strong>Legal Identity</strong> of the <strong>Identity Owner</strong>. For example, all parties should be able to verify that some DID is used by a Government to publish schemas for some document type. The second type is a <strong>Pseudonym</strong> - a <strong>Blinded Identifier</strong> used to maintain privacy in the context of an ongoing digital relationship (<strong>Connection</strong>). If the Pseudonym is used to maintain only one digital relationship we will call it a Pairwise-Unique Identifier. We will use Pairwise-Unique Identifiers to maintain secure connections between actors in this tutorial.</p>
<p>The creation of a DID known to the Ledger is an <strong>Identity Record</strong> itself (NYM transaction). The NYM transaction can be used for creation of new DIDs that is known to that ledger, the setting and rotation of a verification key, and the setting and changing of roles. The most important fields of this transaction are <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dest</span></code> (target DID), <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">role</span></code> (role of a user NYM record being created for) and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">verkey</span></code> (target verification key). See <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/requests.md">Requests</a> to get more information about supported ledger transactions.</p>
<p>Publishing with a DID verification key allows a person, organization or thing, to verify that someone owns this DID as that person, organization or thing is the only one who knows the corresponding signing key and any DID-related operations requiring signing with this key.</p>
<p>Our ledger is public permissioned and anyone who wants to publish DIDs needs to get the role of <strong>Trust Anchor</strong> on the ledger. A <strong>Trust Anchor</strong> is a person or organization that the ledger already knows about, that is able to help bootstrap others. (It is <em>not</em> the same as what cybersecurity experts call a “trusted third party”; think of it more like a facilitator). See <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TWXF7NtBjSOaUIBeIH77SyZnawfo91cJ_ns4TR-wsq4/edit#gid=0">Roles</a> to get more information about roles.</p>
<p><strong>The first step towards being able to place transactions on the ledger involves getting the role of Trust Anchor on the ledger. Faber College, Acme Corp and Thrift Bank will need to get the role of Trust Anchor on the ledger so they can create Verinyms and Pairwise-Unique Identifiers to provide the service to Alice.</strong></p>
<p>Becoming a <strong>Trust Anchor</strong> requires contacting a person or organization who already has the <strong>Trust Anchor</strong> role on the ledger. For the sake of the demo, in our empty test ledger we have only NYMs with the <strong>Steward</strong> role, but all <strong>Stewards</strong> are automatically <strong>Trust Anchors</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-2-connecting-to-the-indy-nodes-pool">
<span id="step-2-connecting-to-the-indy-nodes-pool"></span><h3>Step 2: Connecting to the Indy Nodes Pool<a class="headerlink" href="#step-2-connecting-to-the-indy-nodes-pool" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We are ready to start writing the code that will cover Alice’s use case from start to finish. It is important to note that for demo purposes it will be a single test that will contain the code intended to be executed on different agents. We will always point to what Agent is intended to execute each code part. Also we will use different wallets to store the DID and keys of different Agents. Let’s begin.</p>
<p>The first code block will contain the code of the <strong>Steward’s</strong> agent.</p>
<p><strong>To write and read the ledger’s transactions after gaining the proper role, you’ll need to make a connection to the Indy nodes pool. To make a connection to the different pools that exist, like the Sovrin pool or the <a class="reference external" href="../../README.md#how-to-start-local-nodes-pool-with-docker">local pool we started by ourselves</a> as part of this tutorial, you’ll need to set up a pool configuration.</strong></p>
<p>The list of nodes in the pool is stored in the ledger as NODE transactions. Libindy allows you to restore the actual list of NODE transactions by a few known transactions that we call genesis transactions. Each <strong>Pool Configuration</strong> is defined as a pair of pool configuration name and pool configuration JSON. The most important field in pool configuration json is the path to the file with the list of genesis transactions. Make sure this path is correct.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pool.create_pool_ledger_config</span></code> call allows you to create a named pool configuration. After the pool configuration is created we can connect to the nodes pool that this configuration describes by calling <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pool.open_pool_ledger</span></code>. This call returns the pool handle that can be used to reference this opened connection in future libindy calls.</p>
<p>The code block below contains each of these items. Note how the comments denote that this is the code for the “Steward Agent.”</p>

<span id="step-3-getting-the-ownership-for-steward-s-verinym"></span><h3>Step 3: Getting the ownership for Steward’s Verinym<a class="headerlink" href="#step-3-getting-the-ownership-for-steward-s-verinym" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Next, the Steward’s agent should get the ownership for the DID that has corresponding NYM transactions with the Steward role on the ledger.</strong></p>
<p>The test ledger we use was pre-configured to store some known <strong>Steward</strong> NYMs. Also we know <strong>seed</strong> values for the random number generator that were used to generate keys for these NYMs. These <strong>seed</strong> values allow us to restore signing keys for these DIDs on the <strong>Steward’s</strong> agent side and as a result get the DID ownership.</p>
<p>Libindy has a concept of the <strong>Wallet</strong>. The wallet is secure storage for crypto materials like DIDs, keys, etc… To store the <strong>Steward’s</strong> DID and corresponding signkey, the agent should create a named wallet first by calling <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wallet.create_wallet</span></code>. After this the named wallet can be opened by calling <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wallet.open_wallet</span></code>. This call returns the wallet handle that can be used to reference this opened wallet in future libindy calls.</p>
<p>After the wallet is opened we can create a DID record in this wallet by calling <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">did.create_and_store_my_did</span></code> that returns the generated DID and verkey part of the generated key. The signkey part for this DID will be stored in the wallet too, but it is impossible to read it directly.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> We provided only information about the seed to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">did.create_and_store_my_did</span></code>, but not any information about the Steward’s DID. By default DID’s are generated as the first 16 bytes of the verkey. For such DID’s, when dealing with operations that require both a DID and the verkey we can use the verkey in an abbreviated form. In this form the verkey starts with a tilde ‘~’ followed by 22 or 23 characters. The tilde indicates that the DID itself represents the first 16 bytes of the verkey and the string following the tilde represents the second 16 bytes of the verkey, both using base58Check encoding.</p>

<p><strong>Faber, Acme, Thrift and Government should now establish a Connection with the Steward.</strong></p>
<p>Each connection is actually a pair of Pairwise-Unique Identifiers (DIDs). The one DID is owned by one party to the connection and the second by another.</p>
<p>Both parties know both DIDs and understand what connection this pair describes.</p>
<p>The relationship between them is not shareable with others; it is unique to those two parties in that each pairwise relationship uses different DIDs.</p>
<p>We call the process of establish a connection <strong>Onboarding</strong>.</p>
<p>In this tutorial we will describe the simple version of onboarding process.
In our case, one party will always be the Trust Anchor. Real enterprise scenarios can use a more complex version.</p>

<p>A credential is a piece of information about an identity — a name, an age, a credit score… It is information claimed to be true. In this case, the credential is named, “Transcript”.</p>
<p>Credentials are offered by an issuer.</p>
<p>An issuer may be any identity owner known to the Ledger and any issuer may issue a credential about any identity owner it can identify.</p>
<p>The usefulness and reliability of a credential are tied to the reputation of the issuer with respect to the credential at hand.
For Alice to self-issue a credential that she likes chocolate ice cream may be perfectly reasonable, but for her to self-issue a credential that she graduated from Faber College should not impress anyone.</p>
<p>As we mentioned in <a class="reference external" href="#about-alice">About Alice</a>, <strong>Alice</strong> graduated from <strong>Faber College</strong>.
After <strong>Faber College</strong> had established a connection with Alice, it created for her a Credential Offer about the issuance of the <strong>Transcript</strong> Credential.</p>

<p>At some time in the future, Alice would like to work for the fictional company, Acme Corp.
Normally she would browse to their website, where she would click on a hyperlink to apply for a job.
Her browser would download a connection request in which her Indy app would open; this would trigger a prompt to Alice, asking her to accept the connection with Acme Corp.
Because we’re using an Indy-SDK, the process is different, but the steps are the same.
The process of the connection establishment is the same as when Faber was accepting the Steward connection request.</p>
<p>After Alice had established connection with Acme, she got the <strong>Job-Application</strong> Proof Request.
A proof request is a request made by the party who needs verifiable proof of having certain attributes and the solving of predicates that can be provided by other verified credentials.</p>
<p>In this case, Acme Corp is requesting that Alice provide a <strong>Job Application</strong>.
The Job Application requires a name, degree, status, SSN and also the satisfaction of the condition about the average mark or grades.</p>
<p>In this case, <strong>Job-Application</strong> Proof Request looks like:</p>

<p>Notice that some attributes are verifiable and some are not.</p>
<p>The proof request says that SSN, degree, and graduation status in the Credential must be formally asserted by an issuer and schema_key. Notice also that the first_name, last_name and phone_number are not required to be verifiable.
By not tagging these credentials with a verifiable status, Acme’s credential request is saying it will accept Alice’s own credential about her names and phone numbers.</p>

<p>She can use it when she applies for her loan, in much the same way that she used her transcript when applying for a job.</p>
<p>There is a disadvantage in this approach to data sharing though, — it may disclose more data than what is strictly necessary. If all Alice needs to do is provide proof of employment, this can be done with an anonymous credential instead. Anonymous credentials may prove certain predicates without disclosing actual values (e.g., Alice is employed full-time, with a salary greater than X, along with her hire date, but her actually salary remains hidden). A compound proof can be created, drawing from credentials from both Faber College and Acme Corp, that discloses only what is necessary.</p>
