# Building binaries of LibIndy for Android

**Not ready for production use! Not fully tested.**

## Prerequisites

- Docker

## Dependencies
- The build scripts downloads the prebuilt dependencies while building. The prebuilt dependencies are available [here](https://github.com/evernym/indy-android-dependencies/tree/master/prebuilt)
- If you want build the dependencies by yourself the instructions for that can be found [here](https://github.com/evernym/indy-android-dependencies)

## How to build.
- Run `indy-sdk/libindy/build-libindy-android.sh` to build libindy for arm, arm64 and x86
    - This generates the libindy zip file with each architecture in the indy-sdk/libindy
    - You can also set the `LIBINDY_VERSION` environment variable to append version number to generated zip file.
- To generate the build for a single architecture run `android.build.sh`
    - e.g  `android.build.sh -d arm` . The flag `-d` will download the dependencies automatically
    - e.g  `android.build.sh arm <PATH_TO_OPENSSL> <PATH_TO_SODIUM> <PATH_TO_ZMQ>`. If `-d` flag is not passed you have to give paths to dependencies

## Usage 
- Unzip the generated library.
- Copy `lib/libindy.so` to the jniLibs folder of your android project
    - `libindy.so` file is the dynamic library which is statically linked to its dependencies. This library can be loaded into apk without having dependencies along with it.
    - `libindy_shared.so` file is the dynamic library which is dunamically linked to its dependencies. you need to pass the dependencies into apk.
    
- Load library using the JNA


## Notes:
Make sure the Android app which is going to use libindy has permissions to write to external storage. 

Add following line to AndroidManifest.xml

`<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>`

Android emulator generally use x86 images

##Known Issues

- The Android build does not successfully compile on OSX
    - It fails on the libzmq linking


# Building binaries of Libnullpay for Android

**Not ready for production use! Not fully tested.**

## Prerequisites

- Docker

## Dependencies
- Libindy for Android


## How to build.
- Unzip `libindy_android_<ARCH>_<VERSION>`
- Copy the extracted folder to `indy-sdk/libnullpay/`
- Run `indy-sdk/libnullpay/build-libnullpay-android.sh` to build libnullpay for arm, arm64 and x86
- To build for individual architecture, run `indy-sdk/libnullpay/android.build.sh -d arm <PATH_TO_LIBINDY>` to build libnullpay for arm
    - Or set env variable `INDY_DIR=<PATH_TO_LIBINDY>` and run `android.build.sh -d arm` to generate for arm
    - Set env variable `INDY_DIR=<PATH_TO_LIBINDY>` and run `android.build.sh -d arm64` to generate for arm64
    - Set env variable `INDY_DIR=<PATH_TO_LIBINDY>` and run `android.build.sh -d x86` to generate for x86
