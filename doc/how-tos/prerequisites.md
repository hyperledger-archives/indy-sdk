# Prerequisites

All how-tos assume that the developer has three things:

1. A functional developer environment, including an IDE/compiler for their
language of choice
2. A version of libindy that's built, installed, and callable in the
system path.
3. A running indy pool.

Instructions for #2 (building and installing libindy) can be found [here](../../README.md#installation). Note that we
recommend building the SDK to eliminate versioning problems; pre-built binaries
may be slightly stale.

Instructions for running an indy pool can be found [here](../../README.md#how-to-start-local-nodes-pool-with-docker).
