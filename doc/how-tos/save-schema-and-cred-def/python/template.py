"""
Example demonstrating how to write Schema and Cred Definition on the ledger

As a setup, Steward (already on the ledger) adds Trust Anchor to the ledger.

After that, Steward builds the SCHEMA request to add new schema to the ledger.
Once that succeeds, Trust Anchor uses anonymous credentials to issue and store
claim definition for the Schema added by Steward.
