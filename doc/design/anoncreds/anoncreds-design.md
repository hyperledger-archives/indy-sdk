## Design Goals

* Indy SDK and Indy Node should use the same format for public Anoncreds entities (Schema, Credential Definition, Revocation Registry Definition, Revocation Registry Delta)
* Indy SDK and Indy Node should use the same entities referencing approach
* It should be possible to integrate additional claim signature and revocation schemas without breaking API changes
* API should provide flexible and pluggable approach to handle revocation tails files
* API should provide the way to calculate revocation witness values on cloud agent to avoid downloading of the hole tails file on edge devices

```Rust

/// interoperability.

/// Schema is public and intended to be shared with all anoncreds workflow actors usually by publishing SCHEMA transaction
/// to Indy distributed ledger.

/// issuer_did: DID of schema issuer
/// name: a name the schema
/// version: a version of the schema

### Blob Storage

CL revocation schema introduces Revocation Tails entity used to hide information about revoked claims in public Revocation Registry. Tails

* are static (once generated) array of BigIntegers that can be represented as binary blob or file
* may require quite huge amount of data (up to 1GB per Revocation Registry);
* are created and shared by Issuers;
* are required (so must be available for download) for both Provers and Issuers;
* can be cached and can be downloaded only once;
* Some operation (incremental witness updates) can require reading only small part of blob file. It can be more efficient to store complete tails blob in the cloud and ask for small parts through network.

As result the way how to access tails blobs can be very application specific. To address this SDK will provide the following:

* API for registering custom handler for blobs reading
* API for registering custom handler for blobs writing
* API for blob consistency validation
* Default handlers implementation that will allow to read blobs from local file and write blobs to local file.

Tails publishing and access workflow can be integrated with Indy Node in the following way:

* Issuer generates tails and writes tails blob to local file (with default handler). Our API will also provide blob hash to him and generate URI based on configurable URI pattern.
* Issuer uploads blob to some CDN with corresponded URI (out of SDK scope)
* Issuer sends REVOC_REG_DEF transaction with and publishes tails URI and hash
* Prover sends GET_REVOC_REG_DEF requests and receives tails URI and hash
* Prover downloads published tails file and stores it locally (Out of SDK)
